# The documentation for every route possible for the API

Almost all the routes that can be accessed require authentication by the server. Examples and instructions can be found in the corresponding documentation for the /auth route.
Every requested that can be performed in REST has a GraphQL counterpart as is reflected in the documentation.

We are working continuously to add more plants, animals, diseases and plants to the database. Contribution is always welcome.
